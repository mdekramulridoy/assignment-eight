## React Fundamental Concepts Used in the Project

1. **Components**: Building reusable UI components like Navbar, Footer, Product Cards, etc.
2. **State Management**: Using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state in functional components.
3. **Routing**: Using `react-router-dom` for navigating between pages (e.g., Product Details, Cart, Wishlist).
4. **Props**: Passing data between components via props for dynamic rendering of content.
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Rendering components conditionally.
6. **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions.
7. **Effect Hooks**: Using `useEffect` .

## Data Handling & Management
The following methods are used:

**Local Storage**: Local storage is used to persist the cart and wishlist data across sessions.
   - Cart data is stored and retrieved from localStorage to maintain the cart even after page refresh.
   - Wishlist data is similarly stored in localStorage.


## 5 Features of the Website/Project
1. **Product Details Page**: Allows users to view detailed information.
2. **Add to Cart and Wishlist**: Users can add products to their cart or wishlist with real-time updates and notifications.
3. **Persistent Cart and Wishlist**: Cart and wishlist data is persisted using localStorage, so users can continue shopping even after refreshing or re-opening the page.
4. **Custom Toast Notifications**: Toast notifications are used for displaying real-time feedback, such as when an item is added to the cart or wishlist, enhancing the user experience.
5. **Dynamic Page Titles**: When users navigate to different pages, the page title will automatically change, such as for the Home page, Dashboard, or Statistics page.
